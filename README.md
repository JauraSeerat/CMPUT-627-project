### Detecting Fake Reviews by Feature Engineering and Machine Learning


In this project, we are attempting the problem of Fake Review Detection. We explore rule-base, machine learning and aggregation based approaches. The rules were based on our data analysis. For machine learning we consider dealing with textual and non-textual features separately. To get the best of both rule-base and machine learning, we explore different combination/aggregation mehancism in our project.
